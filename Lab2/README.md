This dataset contains survey responses from 1000 university students around the world.
It includes demographic and academic information such as age, gender, country, university, program level, field of study, year of study, tuition fees, scholarship status, online classes, and several rating variables (campus facilities, teaching quality, and overall satisfaction).
The machine learning problem is a supervised regression problem.
The goal is to predict the overall_satisfaction score of a student based on the other available features, such as tuition, program level, online classes, and ratings of campus facilities and teaching quality.
